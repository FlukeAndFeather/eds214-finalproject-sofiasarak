# EDS214: Final Project

This code attempts to replicate Figure 3 of the following paper:

Schaefer, Douglas. A., William H. McDowell, Fredrick N. Scatena, and Clyde E. Asbury. 2000. “Effects of Hurricane Disturbance on Stream Water Concentrations and Fluxes in Eight Tropical Forest Watersheds of the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico.” *Journal of Tropical Ecology* 16 (2): 189–207. <https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266467400001358>.

The figure summarizes the fluctuations of stream water chemistry of the Luquillo Experimental Forest of the Luquillo Mountains in Puerto Rico. It utilizes moving averages on a 9-week intervals of five different nutrients, **data** for which is available within the data folder of this repo, as well through the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://eds-214-workflows-reproducibility.github.io/course-materials/interactive/edirepository.org).

## Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning and Wrangling

### 2. Calculating Moving Averages

### 3. Plotting
