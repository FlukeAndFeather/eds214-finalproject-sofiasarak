## Background

This document aims to reproduce Figure 3 from Schaefer et al. 2000, cited below. Data comes from the Environmental Data Initiative under the data package also titled "Chemistry of stream water from the Luquillo Mountains". It takes a look at nutrient values of stream water in Puerto Rico over time. The paper specifically aims to analyze the fluctuations in nutrients relative to weather patterns, like hurricanes.

## Data

```{r}
#| include: false
bisley_streams <- read_csv(here("outputs", "bisley_streams_clean.csv"))
bisley_streams_sum <- read_csv(here("outputs", "bisley_streams_sum.csv"))
```

This contains nutrient values from the years 1988 to 1996. This analysis also focuses on only four sites within the Bisley watershed (Puento Roto Mameyes and Bisley Quedraba Preta 1, 2, and 3).

A quick summary of the data is below. It includes the minimum, maximum, and mean values of the nutrient concentrations, independent of site and year. It is meant to provide a better understanding of the range of concentrations across the years. Nutrient values are in the following units:

Calcium (ca): mg l\^-1

Potassium (K): mg l\^-1

Magnesium (Mg): mg l\^-1

Ammonium nitrogen (nh4_n): micrograms l\^-1

Nitrate-N (no3_n): micrograms l\^-1

```{r}
#| echo: false
bisley_streams_sum 
```

## Methods

Figure 3 calls for the use of moving averages. We created a moving average function that ran over a 9-week interval, just as the methods in the paper. It included each date from the Sample Date column as the "focal date", and took the mean of all the values within the 9-week period.

Code for the moving_average function can be seen below.

```{r}
moving_average <- function(focal_date, dates, value, interval_wks) {
  # calculating interval window within dates vector
  is_in_window <- (dates > focal_date - (interval_wks / 2) * 7) &
    (dates < focal_date + (interval_wks / 2) * 7)
  
  # subsetting the values that correspond with your interval window
   window_value <- value[is_in_window]
   
  # printing result
  result <- mean(window_value, na.rm = TRUE)
  return(result)
}
```

## Results

After producing rolling averages for each of the five nutrients and plotting them separately using ggplot, I used the patchwork package to stack them on top of one another.
