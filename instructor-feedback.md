## Exceeds Specs

### Organize: At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file

I have two pieces of functionality that have been refactored into its own file: the moving_average() function as well as two ggplot themes I created for my graphs. Both are in the R folder.

### Document: The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works

My README is well-organized with a step-by-step description of what my repo does, as well as where to find each part of the process within my project. I also include the attempted final product (with citations), and a fun flowchart that I believe summarizes my workflow in a visually-appealing manner.

## Collaboration

Peer collaboration was a good way to see where others were in their project and aid them from my own expertise. For example, working with Kylie helped both of us think about the vertical lines in our plot. It was also interesting to look at Kylie's code because she used the faceting approach, whereas I combined my plots with patchwork. Working with Ava, I was able to point out the lack of an outputs folder, and also help her find the correct code to save a csv file. This helped her save time because she didn't have to Google it like I did!
