# Self Assessment

## Sofia Sarak

## Automate

### Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document

Meets. I only have one quarto document, but I want to exceed this spec by making my quarto document look really nice!

### The analysis runs without errors.

Meets, but my analysis is not finished yet.

### The analysis produces the expected output.

Not yet. I have only created a graph for only one of the nutrients. I also want to clean up and automate my code more.

### Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s).

Not yet. I currently have it all in the same quarto doc, but I will transfer to a new script soon!

## Organize

### Raw data is contained in its own folder.

Meets. My raw data files are in their own folder called data!

### Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data.

Not yet. I will soon save my main data frame as it's own csv () and then call it within my quarto document

### At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file.

Meets, but I hope this exceed this spec by refactoring another function! I currently have my moving_average function in it's own r script and I am sourcing it in my quarto doc.

## Document

### The repo has a README that explains where to find data, analysis script, supporting code, and output.

Not yet, but it will be done once I finish my analysis. I currently have the headings set up.

### The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works.

Not yet. I'll complete this once I am done with my analysis!

### The code is appropriately commented.

Meets. I have my code commented before each major line(s) of code, as well as descriptions before each code chunk.

### Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.

Meets, all in lower snake case and short but descriptive.

## Scale

### Running the environmental initialization script installs all required packages.

Not yet, I have to make an environmetnal initalization script, which will be an R script that installs all of the packages I need.

### The analysis script runs without errors.

Meets (but analysis not done).
